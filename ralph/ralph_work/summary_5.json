**The photo-sync infrastructure is fully deployed and ready.** Monthly iCloud syncs are configured to run at 3 AM on the 1st of each month.

**To complete the setup**, you need to:
1. Install Immich (required for storing/viewing photos)
2. Complete 2FA authentication with iCloud (~5 minutes)

**Both tasks can be done in parallel** (~10 minutes total).

**Start here**: `photo-sync/USER_ACTION_REQUIRED.md`

When these are complete, we'll continue with integrating Immich, exposing it at immich.coultonf.com, and verifying the complete pipeline.

---

**Files persisted**: All state saved to `photo-sync/` directory
**Ready for next iteration**: When Immich is installed
**Time to complete user actions**: ~10 minutes
